    <h2>2021: A Year in Review</h2>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>While 2021 was most certainly a hectic year for most people, personally, it was more of a year of discovery.<br> I found new interests and hobbies, and picked back up old hobbies that had been collecting dust for years. I <br>learned things about myself I hadn't known before, and I grew as person. While these past couple of years <br> have placed a shadow on our future, by the end of 2021, I was starting to see the light again.</p>
